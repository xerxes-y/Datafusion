# DataFusion Project Architecture

## Overview
This project is a scalable data processing system that uses DataFusion for SQL processing on CSV and Parquet data. The system architecture consists of several key components, each playing a specific role in data processing and management.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Processing Engine (DataFusion)
- **What is it?** DataFusion is an Apache Arrow-based SQL processing engine
- **Why?** 
  - High performance in analytical data processing
  - Support for various data formats (CSV, Parquet)
  - Excellent integration with Rust ecosystem
  - Automatic query optimization

### 2. Messaging System (Kafka)
- **What is it?** Apache Kafka as a distributed messaging platform
- **Why?**
  - High reliability
  - Horizontal scalability
  - Support for publish/subscribe pattern
  - Persistent message storage
  - Stream data processing

### 3. Configuration Management (ZooKeeper)
- **What is it?** Apache ZooKeeper for distributed configuration management
- **Why?**
  - Distributed coordination
  - Centralized configuration management
  - Service health monitoring
  - High reliability and stability

### 4. API Server
- **What is it?** REST API for system interaction
- **Why?**
  - Standard interface for system interaction
  - Easy integration with other services
  - Concurrent request management
  - Monitoring and observability

### 5. Monitoring System
- **What is it?** Metrics endpoint for system performance monitoring
- **Why?**
  - System health monitoring
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Problem detection and resolution
  - Performance optimization

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Via API or Kafka
